\section*{Class Features} 

As a trickster, you gain the following class features.

\textbf{Hit Dice:} 1d8

\textbf{Hit Points at 1st Level:} 12 + your Constitution modifier

\textbf{Hit Points at Higher Levels:} 3 + your Constitution modifier per fighter level after 1st


\textbf{Armor:} Light armor, shield

\textbf{Saving Throws:} Dexterity, Intelligence

\textbf{Skills:} Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, and Survival
    
\section*{Cunning} 

You have a poll of cunning dices to use. A common use of your cunning is a strike of luck, performing an inexplicable deed. Each path specializes on the usage of cunning in a different way. For example, a bard mocks his enemies while a rogue tumbles across the battlefield.



\begin{itemize}
    \item You regain all cunning points when finish a short or long rest.
\end{itemize}

Once per round, you either:

\begin{itemize}
    \item regain 1 cunning point whenever you or an ally within sight scores a critical hit. The hit disorients the target and you chase the moment in your favor; or
    \item regain 1 cunning point whenever when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points.
\end{itemize}


Outside of combat, you can apply a cunning to any deception, persuasion, or investigation roll. You can use cunning to cause a diversion and draw attention away from your for your cunning die minutes, e.g., a bard may shout about a muse making the public look at her while a rogue can throw a rock and draw the guard's attention to the noise while she sneaks by.
Ultimately, cunning is a resource 
that you can use to achieve epic things based on smooth talk and subterfuge. 

    
\section*{Expertise} 

Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

\section*{Thrown Weapon Fighting}

Beginning at 1st level, you can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.



\section*{Spellcasting}

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and clever thinking.

\textbf{Cantrips}

You learn three cantrips: Mage Hand and two other cantrips of your choice. 


\textbf{Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher}

You know three 1st-level spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells list.

The Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.


Whenever you gain a level in this class, you learn a new spell. Additionally, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the trickster spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.


\textbf{Spellcasting Ability}

Intelligence or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use your Intelligence or Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence or Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

\textbf{Spell save DC} = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence/Charisma modifier

\textbf{Spell attack modifie}r = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence/Charisma modifier


\section*{Fast Movement}

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.


\section*{Evasion}

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
