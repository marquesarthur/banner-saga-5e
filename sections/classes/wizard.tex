\section{Arcanist}

\subsection*{Arcane Shield}

Twice per combat, when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell, you can spend your reaction to create an invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.

Additional uses of this class feature require spending mana points.

\subsection*{Metamagic}

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. Refer to the arcanists's matamagic table for details.

The more powerful the metamagic, the more instability there is in successfully applying it to a spell. For example, there is always a risk that you won't sculpt a spell to protect all your allies.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

\subsection*{Dispel Weave}

At 5th level, you can suppress any harmful spell effects on a creature or in an area of 20 feet around you. Spend one mana point and roll your mana die, harmful effects are suppressed by your mana die minutes. This class feature requires concentration.

\subsection*{High Weave}

At 9th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose two 1st-level arcanist spels. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

Additionally, apply one of the following effects to your high weave spells:

\header{High Weave Effects}
\begin{rpg-table}
   	Deadly  & Add your mana die as extra damage to one creature hit by the spell.  \\
   	Warding  & A spell that requires concentration or that has a fixed duration (e.g., Mage Armor) and that targets you or an ally grants temporary hit points equal to your mana die \\
    Execrate  & The first time a creature succeeds on a save against your spell, roll your mana die. On a 1, the creature fails. This effect applies only once per spell. \\
\end{rpg-table}



\medskip

\textbf{Named Spell:} Add your name as a suffix or prefix to your high weave spells. For example, if Maya has choose 
magic missle as her high weave, people around the world might start to recognize it as Maya's magic missile. 


\textbf{Cosmetic Changes:} Discuss with your DM any cosmetic changes that distinguish your high weave spells from mudane ones, e.g., Maya's magic missiles are three green darts always floating around her head like a corona. At her command, the darts fly towards a target and a few second after, new darts appear.
