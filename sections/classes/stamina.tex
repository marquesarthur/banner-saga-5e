\section*{Class Features} 

As a combatant, you gain the following class features.

\textbf{Hit Dice:} 1d10

\textbf{Hit Points at 1st Level:} 14 + your Constitution modifier

\textbf{Hit Points at Higher Levels:} 4 + your Constitution modifier per fighter level after 1st


\textbf{Armor:} All armor, shields

\textbf{Weapons:} Simple weapons, martial weapons

\textbf{Saving Throws:} Strength, Constitution

\textbf{Skills:} Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Perception, and Survival 
    
\section*{Stamina} 

You have a poll of stamina dices to use. A common use of your stamina is to enhance an attack in some way. Each path specializes on the usage of stamina in a different way. For example, a fighter has controlled fighting maneuvers while a barbarian uses stamina to endure attacks.



\begin{itemize}
    \item You regain all stamina points when finish a short or long rest.
    \item You regain 1 stamina point whenever an enemy scores a critical hit against you;
    \item You regain 1 stamina point whenever an ally within sight is knocked unconscious;
    \item You regain 2 stamina points when you get bloodied.
\end{itemize}

Outside of combat, you can apply a stamina die to double you jump distance (long jump or high jump), gain bonus to any athletics roll, or hold a collapsing portal, tunnel, wall, etc. for your stamina die minutes. Ultimately, stamina is a resource 
that you can use to achieve epic things based on your sheer physical strength. 

   
\section*{Extra Attack} 

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


\section*{Fighting Style}

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.


\begin{itemize}
    \item Archery You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
    \item Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. 
    \item Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
    \item GWF When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. 
    \item TWF When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Indomitable}

Beginning at 7th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
