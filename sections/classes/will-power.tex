\section*{Mana} 

You have a pool of mana dices to use. Spell-weavers use mana to bend reality. Novice spell-weavers use mana to mend wounds while seasoned ones apply powerful metamagic to their spells.



\begin{itemize}
    \item You regain all mana points when finish a long rest.
    \item You can sacrifice part of your life force to regain mana points. Roll your Hit dice you regain 1 mana point or 2 in case you roll a six.
\end{itemize}


    
\section*{Mend} 

As a bonus action, you can spend one mana point and a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you regains Hit Points equal to 1d6 + your Spellcasting Ability modifier.



\section*{Spellcasting}

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality through sheer force of will.

\textbf{Cantrips}

You learn three cantrips draw from the cleric, wizard, or druid spell list. 


\textbf{Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher}

You know three 1st-level spells of your choice.

The Spell-weaver Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.


Whenever you gain a level in this class, you learn two new spells. Additionally, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the trickster spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

As per your GM discretion, you can learn spells through other means. Please remember that at the end of the day it's up to you and your GM do reach consensus on when it's appropriate to learn spells in this exceptional way.

\textbf{Spellcasting Ability}

Intelligence or Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use your Intelligence or Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

\textbf{Spell save DC} = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence/Wisdom modifier

\textbf{Spell attack modifier} = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence/Wisdom modifier


\section*{Weave Ward}

You weave arcane energy to create a protective ward that boost the party's morale.

Starting at 7th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 20 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
