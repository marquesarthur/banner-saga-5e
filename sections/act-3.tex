\chapter{Act III}





\begin{rpg-commentbox}{}
    
    Things upstair might have gone south. Even though the crew has side-arms, and a weapons-locker, the creature over took them by surprise. In fact, the alien at this act is at its full potential, stage III. \textbf{Alien has stats of a Xenomorph Praetorian. Reroll 1s as it doesn't have call the guard but keep 2s roll.}

\section{War zone}


\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Let's get the hell out of here}
   The PCs must fetch the corporate card at the safe on the crew quarters. \textbf{mobility} vs \textbf{observation}

   When they reach the safe, they discover that it has been cracked open and the card is not there.

   \medskip

    The players might also want to grab side arms or heavy weapons at the weapons locker. For the heavy weapons, they need Mageed's card.
    Mageed is not found anywhere.
\end{rpg-commentbox}



\begin{rpg-commentbox}{What happened here?}
    If players decide to view the logs in the mainframe, they discover that part of the crew has locked themselves in the space shuttle and are waiting 
    for the prisoners to blow the hatch so they can escape instead. \textbf{manipulation} \textbf{command}

    There has to be something in favor of the players, e.g., all pilots are dead and the only person with piloting skills is among the players or in desperation to escape the crew forgot to open some magnetic grips attached to the ship due to security protocols. \textbf{heavy machinery}

    Make all negotiations stressful while the alien havocs the hangar. If players take too long, the Praetorian will produce exo-parasites and drop them on the station so they can hunt new hosts.
 \end{rpg-commentbox}

 
\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Do we really need to kill this thing?}
    Players may get clever and crawl through the ducts and put an explosive on the hangar door sucking the air of the station and the alien. 
    
    Use some of the heavy weapons and diversions to not confront the creature directly, etc.

    Reward clever thinking but punish time lost if decisions are not made fast enough
