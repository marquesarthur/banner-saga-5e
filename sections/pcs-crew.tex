    The chief engineer of the station. This was supposed to be an one-year temporary job. One year turned into two, then into five. You would love to see the place collapse and get a job somewhere safer.

    Chief medic on the station. You live for your job and you actually believe in redemption. You decided to work at this place by choice and all the prisoners seem to understand that. If one person can walk freely in the prison block, that person is you.
