Let the PCs talk and discover few things about Tery and Kathia. 

Mageed will communicate with them saying that they have a plan to escape the station but they new Kathia's corporate card. 

Mageed is also updated about the creature in the refinery. He mentions that one of the crew members is having seizures in the crew's quarters. The PCs hear him asking someone to go check if he is better.


The plan is to overload the refinery core reactor while someone hacks the mainframe. With a backdoor in place, it may be possible to override lockdown protocol for doors and the elevator. 


Before overriding the reactor, the prisoners must also gather enough barrels of sulfuric acid to use at the hangar door to crack it open so that they can get into the ship.


Make the PCs doubt that Mageed would let them escape.

The PCs must carefully load the canisters with sulfuric acid while the alien actively search for them. 

At some point there should be a chase scene near the panel with ultraviolet radiation. The Alien tries to stab someone that runs through the non-shielded vicinity. 

A successful observation check will alert players that the creature is vulnerable to ultraviolet light.

Kohru is a lithium refinery. The ore is extracted in the mining section and sent via pipes for processing. 



\begin{quotation}
\begin{small}
\textit{Lithium is a highly reactive alkali metal that offers excellent heat and electrical conductivity.  These properties make it particularly useful for the manufacture of glass, high-temperature lubricants, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and lithium ion batteries for electric cars and consumer electronics}

\textit{The process for recovering lithium from ore can vary based on the specific mineral deposit in question. In general, the process entails removing the mineral material from the earth then heating and pulverizing it. The crushed mineral powder is combined with chemical reactants, such as sulfuric acid, then the slurry is heated, filtered, and concentrated through an evaporation process to form saleable lithium carbonate, while the resulting wastewater is treated for reuse or disposal.    }
